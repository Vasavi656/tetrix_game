# Tetris Game  

A **Tetris-inspired game** featuring block movement, rotation, collision detection, and a scoring system. This project demonstrates core **DSA concepts**, including matrix operations, grid-based state management, and event handling to create an interactive gaming experience.  

## Features  
- **Block Placement & Rotation** – Uses matrix manipulation to handle smooth block transitions.  
- **Collision Detection** – Ensures blocks land correctly and prevents overlaps.  
- **Grid-Based State Management** – Dynamically updates the game state as blocks move and stack.  
- **Scoring System** – Awards points when rows are cleared, encouraging competitive gameplay.  

## Technologies Used  
- **JavaScript (Canvas API)** – For rendering and managing game elements.  
- **DSA Concepts** – Matrix operations, collision detection, and game state updates.  

## How to Play  
1. **Arrow Keys** – Move and rotate blocks.  
2. **Clear Rows** – Earn points by completing full rows.  
3. **Survive Longer** – As the game progresses, blocks fall faster!
